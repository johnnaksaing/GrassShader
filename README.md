# GrassShader
shader study for unity project

what is this repo?
this repo is a unity project sandbox for studing unity / especially unity shader.  
shader language is very different and unfamiliar for C# users. it even requires background knowledge for graphics & GPU hardware.  
despite of these huddle, literacy of a shader language makes programmer to create tremendous creative contents such as massive objects, tech-arts, etc.  

i did some practices here, and i leave those practices here as a scratch pad which can be reused anytime i need.




study's objectives
1. create a unity shader which includes Grass Generation, Player Interaction(Trampled, Croped, etc), and some other awesome stuff.
2. create a editor material paint for level designer.

1. day 0 : create empty unity project, empty material-placeholder gameobject
2. day 1 : create a grass shader
3. day 2 : make it interactable
4. day 3 : do some other things
5. day 4 : make a document

Plan
1. day 0 : learn compute shader
